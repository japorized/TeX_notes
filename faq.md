## How do I use this site?

  Grab whatever PDF or tex source files you wish. Use the search box to filter for the course or title you want. Use the .tex files toggle to show the tex files.

## Why in the world do most of your documents use dark backgrounds and white text!? That ain't normal! And studies show that white background is better!

  I use my notes for long periods of time, and I want as little strain on my eye as possible. White background hurts my eye. Simple as that. I will, however, compile a copy with a white background when circumstances demand, or when I'm done with the set of notes. I'm not saying that I don't use documents with white background, in fact I do when it's bright out.

## The colours in your PDFs don't look exactly like what I think they should be, e.g. red doesn't look... red

  It's [base16-eighties](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Here's a reference for the colors:

## Your pages on this site looks awesome! Heck your FAQ looks good even though it doesn't look much!

## This site is too good to be true. You sure you're not doing malicious things to my data when I'm here?

  Feel free to [check the source](https://gitlab.com/japorized/TeX_notes). They're short so shouldn't take you too long. The Javascript of the site are meant only for two features for now:

  - the search functionality, which is a bit of a hack by me using the title of each set of notes as an id;
  - the night mode auto-toggle, which uses your system time.
