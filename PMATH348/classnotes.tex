This is a 3 part course; it is separated into
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Sylow's Theorem}

    which is a leftover from group theory (\href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH347S18/classnotes.pdf}{PMATH 347}). It has little to do with the rest of the course, but PMATH 347 was a course that is already content-rich to a point where Sylow's Theorem gets pushed into the later course that is this course.

  \item \textbf{Field Theory}

    is a somewhat understood concept from ring theory, where we learned that it is a special case of a ring where all of its elements have an inverse.

  \item \textbf{Galois Theory}

    is the beautiful theory from the French mathematican Ã‰variste Galois that ties field theory back to group theory. This allows us to reduce certain field theory problems into group theory, which, in some sense, is easier and better understood.

Recall Lagrange's Theorem.

\begin{thm}[Lagrange's Theorem]\index{Lagrange's Theorem}\label{thm:lagrange_s_theorem}
  If $G$ is a finite group and $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ \sidenote{I shall write this as $H \leq G$ from hereon.}, then $\abs{H} \mid \abs{G}$ \sidenote{This just means $\abs{H}$ divides $\abs{G}$.}.
\end{thm}

The full converse is not true.

\begin{eg}
  Let $G = A_4$, the \hlnotea{alternating group} of $4$ elements. Then $\abs{G} = 12$ \sidenote{Recall that the symmetric group of $4$ elements $S_4$ has order $4! = 24$, and an alternating group has half of its elements.}. We have that $6 \mid 12$. We shall show that $G$ has no subgroup of order $6$.

  Suppose to the contrary that $H \leq G$ such that $\abs{H} = 6$. Let $a \in G$ such that $\abs{a} = 3$ \sidenote{i.e. the order of $a$ is $3$. This is a \hlimpo{trick}.} There are $8$ such elements in $G$ \sidenote{This shall be left as an exercise.
  \begin{ex}
    Prove that there are $8$ elements in $G$ that have order $3$.
  \end{ex}}. Note that the \hlnotea{index}\sidenote{The index of a subgroup is the number of unique cosets generated by $H$.} of $H$, $\abs{G : H}$, is $\frac{\abs{G}}{\abs{H}} = 2$.

  Now consider the \hlnotea{cosets} $H$, $aH$ and $a^2 H$. Since $\abs{G : H} = 2$, we must have either
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $aH = H \implies a \in H$;
    \item $aH = a^H \overset{\text{`multiply' } a^{-1}}{\implies} H = aH \implies a \in H$; or
    \item $a^2H = H \overset{\text{`multiply' } a}{\implies} H = aH \implies a \in H$.
  \end{itemize}
  Thus all $8$ elements of order $3$ are in $H$ but $\abs{H} = 6$, a contradiction. Therefore, no such subgroup (of order $6$) exists.
\end{eg}

Our goal now is to establish a partial converse of Lagrange's Theorem. To that end, we shall first lay down some definitions.

\begin{defn}[$p$-Group]\index{$p$-Group}\label{defn:_p_group}
  Let $p$ be prime. We say that a group $G$ is a \hlnoteb{$p$-group} if $\abs{G} = p^k$ for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$. For $H \leq G$, we say that $H$ is a $p$-subgroup of $G$ if $H$ is a $p$-group.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Sylow $p$-Subgroup]\index{Sylow $p$-Subgroup}\label{defn:sylow_p_subgroup}
  Let $G$ be a group such that $\abs{G} = p^n m$ for some $n, m \in \mathbb{N}$, such that $p \nmid m$. If $H \leq G$ with order $p^n$, we call $H$ a \hlnoteb{Sylow $p$-subgroup}.
\end{defn}

Recall Cauchy's Theorem for abelian groups\sidenote{In the course I was in, we were introduced only to the full theorem and actually went through this entire part. See notes on \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH347S18/classnotes.pdf}{PMATH 347}.}.

\begin{thm}[Cauchy's Theorem for Abelian Groups]\index{Cauchy's Theorem for Abelian Groups}\label{thm:cauchy_s_theorem_for_abelian_groups}
  If $G$ is a finite abelian group, and $p$ is prime such that $p \mid \abs{G}$, then $\abs{G}$ has an element of order $p$.
\end{thm}

\begin{defn}[Stabilizers and Orbits]\index{Stabilizers}\index{Orbits}\label{defn:stabilizers_and_orbits}
  Let $G$ be a finite group which acts on a finite set $X$ \sidenote{Recall that a group action is a function $\cdot : G \times X \to X$ such that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $g(hx) = (gh)x$; and
    \item $ex = x$.
  \end{enumerate}}. For $x \in X$, the \hlnoteb{stabilizers} of $x$ is the set
  \begin{equation*}
    \stab(x) := \{ g \in G : g x = x \} \leq G.
  \end{equation*}
  The orbits of $x$ is a set
  \begin{equation*}
    \orb(x) := \{ gx : g \in G \}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  One can verify that the function $G / \stab(x) \to \orb(x)$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    g \stab(x) \mapsto gx
  \end{equation*}
  is a bijection.
\end{note}

\begin{thm}[Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem]\index{Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem}\label{thm:orbit_stabilizer_theorem}
  Let $G$ be a group acting on a set $X$, and for each $x \in X$, $\stab(x)$ and $\orb(x)$ are the stabilizers and orbits of $x$, respectively. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{G} = \abs{\stab(x)} \cdot \abs{\orb(x)}.
  \end{equation*}
  Moreover, if $x, y \in X$, then either $\orb(x) \cap \orb(y) = \emptyset$ or $\orb(x) = \orb(y)$.
\end{thm}

The theorem is actually equivalent to \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH347S18/classnotes.pdf#thm.45}{Proposition 45} in the notes for PMATH 347. However, feel free to...

\begin{ex}
  prove \cref{thm:orbit_stabilizer_theorem} as an exercise.
\end{ex}

Consequently, we have that
\begin{equation*}
  \abs{X} = \sum \abs{\orb(a_i)},
\end{equation*}
where $a_i$ are the distinct orbit representatives. Letting
\begin{equation*}
  X_G := \{ x \in X : gx = x, g \in G \},
\end{equation*}
we have...

\begin{thm}[Orbit Decomposition Theorem]\index{Orbit Decomposition Theorem}\label{thm:orbit_decomposition_theorem}
  \begin{equation*}
    \abs{X} = \abs{X_G} + \sum_{a_i \notin X_G} \abs{\orb(a_i)}.
  \end{equation*}
