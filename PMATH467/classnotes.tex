The basic goal of the course is to be able to find \hlnotea{algebraic invariants}, which we shall use to classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism.

Other questions that we shall also look into include a uniqueness problem about manifolds; in particular, how many manifolds exist for a given invariant up to homeomorphism? We shall see that for a \hlnotea{2-manifold}, the only such manifold is the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. For a $4$-manifold, it is the $4$-dimensional sphere $S^4$. In fact, for any other $n$-manifold for $n > 4$, the unique manifold is the respective $n$-sphere. The problem is trickier with the $3$-manifold, and it is known as the Poincar\'{e} Conjecture, solved in 2003 by Russian Mathematician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman}{Grigori Perelman}. Indeed, the said manifold is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere.

For this course, you are expected to be familiar with notions from \hlnotea{real analysis}, such as topology, and concepts from \hlnotea{group theory}.

The following topics shall be covered:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Point-Set Topology
  \item Introduction to Topological Manifolds
  \item Simplicial complexes \& Introduction to Homology
  \item Fundamental Groups \& Covering Spaces
  \item Classification of Surfaces
\end{enumerate}

\section{Euclidean Space}%
\label{sec:euclidean_space}
% section euclidean_space

For any $(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \in \mathbb{R}^m$, we can measure its distance from the origin $0$ using either
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\norm{x}_\infty = \max \{ \abs{ x_i } \}$ (the supremum-norm);
  \item $\norm{x}_2 = \sqrt{ \sum (x_j)^2 }$ (the $2$-norm); or
  \item $\norm{x}_p = \left( \sum \abs{ x_j }^p \right)^\frac{1}{p}$ (the $p$-norm),
\end{itemize}
where we may define a ``distance'' by
\begin{equation*}
  d_p(x, y) = \norm{ x - y }_p.
\end{equation*}

\begin{defn}[Metric]\index{Metric}\label{defn:metric}
  Let $X$ be an arbitrary space. A function $d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is called a \hlnoteb{metric} if it satisfies
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item (symmetry) $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ for any $x, y \in X$;
    \item (positive definiteness) $d(x, y) \geq 0$ for any $x, y \in X$, and $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$; and
    \item (triangle inequality) $\forall x, y, z \in X$
      \begin{equation*}
        d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(y, z).
      \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Open and Closed Sets]\index{Open sets}\index{Closed sets}\label{defn:open_and_closed_sets}
  Given a space $X$ with a metric $d$, and $r > 0$, the set
  \begin{equation*}
    B(x, r) := \{ w \in X \mid d(x, w) < r \}
  \end{equation*}
  is called the \hlnoteb{open ball} of radius $r$ centered at $x$. An \hlnoteb{open set} $A$ is such that $\forall a \in A$, $\exists r > 0$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    B(a, r) \subseteq A.
  \end{equation*}
  We say that a set is \hlnoteb{closed} if its complement is open.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Continuous Map]\index{Continuous Map}\label{defn:continuous_map}
  A function
  \begin{equation*}
    f : (X, d_1) \to (Y, d_2)
  \end{equation*}
  is said to be \hlnoteb{continuous} if the preimage of an open set in $Y$ is open in $X$.\marginnote{See \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH351F18/classnotes.pdf\#thm.45}{notes} on Real Analysis for why we defined a continuous map in such a way.}
\end{defn}

\begin{warning}
  This definition does not imply that a continuous map $f$ maps open sets to open sets.
\end{warning}

\begin{ex}
  Contruct a function on $[0, 1]$ which assumes all values between its maximum and minimum, but is not continuous.
\end{ex}

\begin{solution}
  Consider the piecewise function
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
      x & 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \\
      x - \frac{1}{2} & x \geq \frac{1}{2}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  It is clear that the maximum and minimum are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $0$ respectively, and $f$ assumes all values between $0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$. However, a piecewise function is not continuous.
\end{solution}

\begin{defn}[Homeomorphism]\index{Homeomorphism}\label{defn:homeomorphism}
  A function $f$ is a \hlnoteb{homeomorphism} if it is a bijection and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  The function
  \begin{equation*}
    g : [ 0, 2\pi ) \to \mathbb{R}^2 \text{ given by } \theta \mapsto (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
  \end{equation*}
  is not homeomorphic, since if we consider an alternating series that converges to $0$ on the unit circle on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we have that the preimage of the series does not converge and $f^{-1}$ is in fact discontinuous.
\end{eg}

\newthought{Now}, we want to talk about topologies without referring to a metric.

\begin{defn}[Topology]\index{Topology}\label{defn:topology}
  Let $X$ be a space. We say that the set $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ is a \hlnoteb{topology} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $X, \emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$;
    \item if $\left\{ x_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in A} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ for an arbitrary index set $A$, then
      \begin{equation*}
        \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} x_\alpha \in \mathcal{T}; \text{ and }
      \end{equation*}
    \item If $\{ x_\beta \}_{\beta \in B} \subset \mathcal{T}$ for some finite index set $B$, then
      \begin{equation*}
        \bigcap_{\beta \in B} x_\beta \in \mathcal{T}.
      \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\section{Euclidean Space (Continued)}%
\label{sec:euclidean_space_continued}
% section euclidean_space_continued

In the last lecture, from metric topology, 
we generalized the notion to a more abstract one
that is based solely on open sets.

\begin{eg}
  Let $X$ be a set. The following two are
  uninteresting examples of topologies:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The \hldefn{trivial topology} $\mathcal{T} = \left\{ \emptyset, X \right\}$.
    \item The \hldefn{discrete topology} $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

\newthought{We shall now} continue with looking at
more concepts that we shall need down the road.

\begin{defn}[Closure of a Set]\index{Closure}\label{defn:closure_of_a_set}
  Let $A$ be a set. Its \hlnoteb{closure},
  denoted as $\bar{A}$, is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    \bar{A} = \bigcap_{C \supset A}^{C: \text{ closed }} C. 
  \end{equation*}
  It is the smallest closed set that contains $A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  In metric topology, one typically defines the closure of a set by taking the union of $A$ and its limit points.
\end{note}

\begin{defn}[Interior of a Set]\index{Interior}\label{defn:interior_of_a_set}
  Let $A$ be a set. Its \hlnoteb{interior}, 
  denoted either as $\text{Int }(A)$, $A^\circ$ or $\Int{A}$,
  is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    \Int{A} = \bigcup_{G \subseteq A}^{G: \text{ open }} G.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Boundary of a Set]\index{Boundary}\label{defn:boundary_of_a_set}
  Let $A$ be a set. Its \hlnoteb{boundary},
  denoted as $\partial A$, is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    \partial A = \bar{A} \setminus \Int{A}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
  Let $A$ be a set. Prove that $\partial A$ is closed.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  Notice that
  \begin{equation*}
    ( \partial A )^C = ( \bar{A} \setminus \Int{A} )^C = X \setminus \bar{A} \cup \Int{A} = X \cap \bar{A}^C \cup \Int{A}
  \end{equation*}
  which is open.\qed\
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}
  Let $A$ be a set. Show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \partial ( \partial A ) = \partial A.
  \end{equation*}
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  First, notice that $\Int{\partial A} = \emptyset$.
  Since $\partial A$ is closed, $\bar{\parital A} = \partial A$.
  Then
  \begin{equation*}
    \partial ( \partial A ) = \bar{\partial A} \setminus \Int{\partial A}
      = \partial A \setminus \emptyset = \partial A
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
  We know that $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
  and $\bar{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$.
  We say that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{eg}

\begin{defn}[Dense]\index{Dense}\label{defn:dense}
  We say that a subset $A$ of a set $X$ is dense if
  \begin{equation*}
    \bar{A} = X.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  From the last example, we have that $\Int{\mathbb{Q}} = \emptyset$.
\end{eg}

\begin{defn}[Limit Point]\index{Limit Point}\label{defn:limit_point}
  We say that $p \in X \supseteq A$ is a limit point of $A$
  if any neighbourhood of $p$ has a nontrivial intersection
  with $A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}[A Topologist's Circle]\label{eg:a_topologists_circle}
  Consider the function 
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
      \sin \frac{1}{x} & x \neq 0 \\
      0                & x = 0
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  on the interval $\left[ -\frac{1}{2 \pi}, \frac{1}{2 \pi} \right]$.
  Extend the function on both ends such that we obtain \cref{fig:a_topologists_circle}
  (See also: \href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/figksl5wmv}{Desmos}).
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{topologists-circle.png}
    \caption{A Topologist's Circle}
    \label{fig:a_topologists_circle}
  \end{figure}

  The limit points of the graph includes all the points
  on the straight line from $(0, -1)$ to $(0, 1)$, including the endpoints.
  This is the case because for any of the points on this line, for any
  neighbourhood around the point, the neighbourhood intersects the
  graph $f$ infinitely many times.
\end{eg}

\newthought{Going back to continuity}, given a function $f$,
how do we know if $f^{-1}$ maps an open set to an open set?

We can actually reduce the problem to only looking at open balls.
But why are we allowed to do that?

\begin{defn}[Basis of a Topology]\index{Basis}\label{defn:basis_of_a_topology}
  \marginnote{Note that while the definition is similar to that of a cover, we are now ``covering'' over sets and not points.}
  Given a topology $\mathcal{T}$, we say that
  $\mathcal{B} = \left\{ B_{\alpha} \right\}_{\alpha \in I}$
  is a \hlnoteb{basis} if $\forall T \in \mathcal{T}$, there
  exists $J \subset I$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    T = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} B_\alpha.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
  Then we can take
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B} = \left\{ (a, b) \mmid a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \, a \leq b \right\}.
  \end{equation*}
  Note that $\mathcal{B}$ is \hlnotea{uncountable}.
  We can, in fact, have
  \sidenote{Recall from
  \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH351F18/classnotes.pdf}{PMATH 351}
  that we can write $\mathbb{R}$ as a disjoint union 
  of open intervals with rational endpoints.}
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B}_1 = \left\{ (a, b) \mmid a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, a \leq b \right\},
  \end{equation*}
  which is countable, as a basis for $\mathbb{R}$.
  Furthermore, we can consider the set
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B}_2 = \left\{ (a, b) \mmid a \leq b, \, a = \frac{m}{2^p}, \, b = \frac{n}{2^q}, \, m, n, p, q \in \mathbb{Z} \right\},
  \end{equation*}
  which is also a countable basis for $\mathbb{R}$.
  Notice that
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{B}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{B}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  In $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can do a similar construction of $\mathcal{B}$,
  $\mathcal{B}_1$, and $\mathcal{B}_2$ as in the last example and use
  them as a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$. In particular, we would have
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B} = \left\{ (a_1, b_1) \times (a_2, b_2) \mmid a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \in \mathbb{R} \right\}.
  \end{equation*}
  This is called a \hldefn{dyadic partitioning} of $\mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Let $(X_1, \mathcal{T}_1)$ and $(X_2, \mathcal{T}_2)$ be two topological spaces.
  Then the Cartesian product $X_1 \times X_2$ has topology induced
  from $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ by taking the set
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B} = \left\{ \beta_1 \times \beta_2 \mmid \beta_1 \in \mathcal{T}_1, \, \beta_2 \in \mathcal{T}_2 \right\}
  \end{equation*}
  as the basis.
\end{eg}

\begin{ex}
  Prove that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ can be taken to be elements of
      bases $\mathcal{B}_1 \subset \mathcal{T}_1$ and
      $\mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{T}_2$, respectively.
    \item the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the same 
      as the Euclidean topology.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}
