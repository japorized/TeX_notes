The basic goal of the course is to be able to find \hlnotea{algebraic invariants}, which we shall use to classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism.

Other questions that we shall also look into include a uniqueness problem about manifolds; in particular, how many manifolds exist for a given invariant up to homeomorphism? We shall see that for a \hlnotea{2-manifold}, the only such manifold is the 2-dimensional sphere $S^2$. For a $4$-manifold, it is the $4$-dimensional sphere $S^4$. In fact, for any other $n$-manifold for $n > 4$, the unique manifold is the respective $n$-sphere. The problem is trickier with the $3$-manifold, and it is known as the Poincar\'{e} Conjecture, solved in 2003 by Russian Mathematician \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman}{Grigori Perelman}. Indeed, the said manifold is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere.

For this course, you are expected to be familiar with notions from \hlnotea{real analysis}, such as topology, and concepts from \hlnotea{group theory}.

The following topics shall be covered:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Point-Set Topology
  \item Introduction to Topological Manifolds
  \item Simplicial complexes \& Introduction to Homology
  \item Fundamental Groups \& Covering Spaces
  \item Classification of Surfaces
\end{enumerate}

\section{Euclidean Space}%
\label{sec:euclidean_space}
% section euclidean_space

For any $(x_1, \ldots, x_m) \in \mathbb{R}^m$, we can measure its distance from the origin $0$ using either
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\norm{x}_\infty = \max \{ \abs{ x_i } \}$ (the supremum-norm);
  \item $\norm{x}_2 = \sqrt{ \sum (x_j)^2 }$ (the $2$-norm); or
  \item $\norm{x}_p = \left( \sum \abs{ x_j }^p \right)^\frac{1}{p}$ (the $p$-norm),
\end{itemize}
where we may define a ``distance'' by
\begin{equation*}
  d_p(x, y) = \norm{ x - y }_p.
\end{equation*}

\begin{defn}[Metric]\index{Metric}\label{defn:metric}
  Let $X$ be an arbitrary space. A function $d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ is called a \hlnoteb{metric} if it satisfies
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item (symmetry) $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$ for any $x, y \in X$;
    \item (positive definiteness) $d(x, y) \geq 0$ for any $x, y \in X$, and $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$; and
    \item (triangle inequality) $\forall x, y, z \in X$
      \begin{equation*}
        d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(y, z).
      \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Open and Closed Sets]\index{Open sets}\index{Closed sets}\label{defn:open_and_closed_sets}
  Given a space $X$ with a metric $d$, and $r > 0$, the set
  \begin{equation*}
    B(x, r) := \{ w \in X \mid d(x, w) < r \}
  \end{equation*}
  is called the \hlnoteb{open ball} of radius $r$ centered at $x$. An \hlnoteb{open set} $A$ is such that $\forall a \in A$, $\exists r > 0$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    B(a, r) \subseteq A.
  \end{equation*}
  We say that a set is \hlnoteb{closed} if its complement is open.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Continuous Map]\index{Continuous Map}\label{defn:continuous_map}
  A function
  \begin{equation*}
    f : (X, d_1) \to (Y, d_2)
  \end{equation*}
  is said to be \hlnoteb{continuous} if the preimage of an open set in $Y$ is open in $X$.\marginnote{See \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH351F18/classnotes.pdf\#thm.45}{notes} on Real Analysis for why we defined a continuous map in such a way.}
\end{defn}

\begin{warning}
  This definition does not imply that a continuous map $f$ maps open sets to open sets.
\end{warning}

\begin{ex}
  Contruct a function on $[0, 1]$ which assumes all values between its maximum and minimum, but is not continuous.
\end{ex}

\begin{solution}
  Consider the piecewise function
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
      x & 0 \leq x < \frac{1}{2} \\
      x - \frac{1}{2} & x \geq \frac{1}{2}.
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  It is clear that the maximum and minimum are $\frac{1}{2}$ and $0$ respectively, and $f$ assumes all values between $0$ and $\frac{1}{2}$. However, a piecewise function is not continuous.
\end{solution}

\begin{defn}[Homeomorphism]\index{Homeomorphism}\label{defn:homeomorphism}
  A function $f$ is a \hlnoteb{homeomorphism} if it is a bijection and both $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are continuous.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  The function
  \begin{equation*}
    g : [ 0, 2\pi ) \to \mathbb{R}^2 \text{ given by } \theta \mapsto (\cos \theta, \sin \theta)
  \end{equation*}
  is not homeomorphic, since if we consider an alternating series that converges to $0$ on the unit circle on $\mathbb{R}^2$, we have that the preimage of the series does not converge and $f^{-1}$ is in fact discontinuous.
\end{eg}

\newthought{Now}, we want to talk about topologies without referring to a metric.

\begin{defn}[Topology]\index{Topology}\label{defn:topology}
  Let $X$ be a space. We say that the set $\mathcal{T} \subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)$ is a \hlnoteb{topology} if
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $X, \emptyset \in \mathcal{T}$;
    \item if $\left\{ x_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in A} \subseteq \mathcal{T}$ for an arbitrary index set $A$, then
      \begin{equation*}
        \bigcup_{\alpha \in A} x_\alpha \in \mathcal{T}; \text{ and }
      \end{equation*}
    \item If $\{ x_\beta \}_{\beta \in B} \subset \mathcal{T}$ for some finite index set $B$, then
      \begin{equation*}
        \bigcap_{\beta \in B} x_\beta \in \mathcal{T}.
      \end{equation*}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{defn}

\section{Euclidean Space (Continued)}%
\label{sec:euclidean_space_continued}
% section euclidean_space_continued

In the last lecture, from metric topology,
we generalized the notion to a more abstract one
that is based solely on open sets.

\begin{eg}
  Let $X$ be a set. The following two are
  uninteresting examples of topologies:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The \hldefn{trivial topology} $\mathcal{T} = \left\{ \emptyset, X \right\}$.
    \item The \hldefn{discrete topology} $\mathcal{T} = \mathcal{P}(X)$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{eg}

\newthought{We shall now} continue with looking at
more concepts that we shall need down the road.

\begin{defn}[Closure of a Set]\index{Closure}\label{defn:closure_of_a_set}
  Let $A$ be a set. Its \hlnoteb{closure},
  denoted as $\bar{A}$, is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    \bar{A} = \bigcap_{C \supset A}^{C: \text{ closed }} C.
  \end{equation*}
  It is the smallest closed set that contains $A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  In metric topology, one typically defines the closure of a set by taking the union of $A$ and its limit points.
\end{note}

\begin{defn}[Interior of a Set]\index{Interior}\label{defn:interior_of_a_set}
  Let $A$ be a set. Its \hlnoteb{interior},
  denoted either as $\text{Int }(A)$, $A^\circ$ or $\Int{A}$,
  is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    \Int{A} = \bigcup_{G \subseteq A}^{G: \text{ open }} G.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Boundary of a Set]\index{Boundary}\label{defn:boundary_of_a_set}
  Let $A$ be a set. Its \hlnoteb{boundary},
  denoted as $\partial A$, is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
    \partial A = \bar{A} \setminus \Int{A}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{ex}
  Let $A$ be a set. Prove that $\partial A$ is closed.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  Notice that
  \begin{equation*}
    ( \partial A )^C = ( \bar{A} \setminus \Int{A} )^C = X \setminus \bar{A} \cup \Int{A} = X \cap \bar{A}^C \cup \Int{A}
  \end{equation*}
  which is open.\qed\
\end{proof}

\begin{ex}
  Let $A$ be a set. Show that
  \begin{equation*}
    \partial ( \partial A ) = \partial A.
  \end{equation*}
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  First, notice that $\Int{\partial A} = \emptyset$.
  Since $\partial A$ is closed, $\bar{\partial A} = \partial A$.
  Then
  \begin{equation*}
    \partial ( \partial A ) = \bar{\partial A} \setminus \Int{\partial A}
      = \partial A \setminus \emptyset = \partial A
  \end{equation*}
\end{proof}

\begin{eg}
  We know that $\mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$,
  and $\bar{\mathbb{Q}} = \mathbb{R}$.
  We say that $\mathbb{Q}$ is dense in $\mathbb{R}$.
\end{eg}

\begin{defn}[Dense]\index{Dense}\label{defn:dense}
  We say that a subset $A$ of a set $X$ is dense if
  \begin{equation*}
    \bar{A} = X.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  From the last example, we have that $\Int{\mathbb{Q}} = \emptyset$.
\end{eg}

\begin{defn}[Limit Point]\index{Limit Point}\label{defn:limit_point}
  We say that $p \in X \supseteq A$ is a limit point of $A$
  if any neighbourhood of $p$ has a nontrivial intersection
  with $A$.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}[A Topologist's Circle]\label{eg:a_topologists_circle}
  Consider the function
  \begin{equation*}
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
      \sin \frac{1}{x} & x \neq 0 \\
      0                & x = 0
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  on the interval $\left[ -\frac{1}{2 \pi}, \frac{1}{2 \pi} \right]$.
  Extend the function on both ends such that we obtain \cref{fig:a_topologists_circle}
  (See also: \href{https://www.desmos.com/calculator/figksl5wmv}{Desmos}).
  \begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{topologists-circle.png}
    \caption{A Topologist's Circle}
    \label{fig:a_topologists_circle}
  \end{figure}

  The limit points of the graph includes all the points
  on the straight line from $(0, -1)$ to $(0, 1)$, including the endpoints.
  This is the case because for any of the points on this line, for any
  neighbourhood around the point, the neighbourhood intersects the
  graph $f$ infinitely many times.
\end{eg}

\newthought{Going back to continuity}, given a function $f$,
how do we know if $f^{-1}$ maps an open set to an open set?

We can actually reduce the problem to only looking at open balls.
But why are we allowed to do that?

\begin{defn}[Basis of a Topology]\index{Basis}\label{defn:basis_of_a_topology}
  \marginnote{Note that while the definition is similar to that of a cover, we are now ``covering'' over sets and not points.}
  Given a topology $\mathcal{T}$, we say that
  $\mathcal{B} = \left\{ B_{\alpha} \right\}_{\alpha \in I}$
  is a \hlnoteb{basis} if $\forall T \in \mathcal{T}$, there
  exists $J \subset I$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    T = \bigcup_{\alpha \in J} B_\alpha.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}\label{eg:basis_of_r_n}
  Let $\mathcal{T}$ be the Euclidean topology on $\mathbb{R}$.
  Then we can take
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B} = \left\{ (a, b) \mmid a, b \in \mathbb{R}, \, a \leq b \right\}.
  \end{equation*}
  Note that $\mathcal{B}$ is \hlnotea{uncountable}.
  We can, in fact, have
  \sidenote{Recall from
  \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH351F18/classnotes.pdf}{PMATH 351}
  that we can write $\mathbb{R}$ as a disjoint union
  of open intervals with rational endpoints.}
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B}_1 = \left\{ (a, b) \mmid a, b \in \mathbb{Q}, a \leq b \right\},
  \end{equation*}
  which is countable, as a basis for $\mathbb{R}$.
  Furthermore, we can consider the set
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B}_2 = \left\{ (a, b) \mmid a \leq b, \, a = \frac{m}{2^p}, \, b = \frac{n}{2^q}, \, m, n, p, q \in \mathbb{Z} \right\},
  \end{equation*}
  which is also a countable basis for $\mathbb{R}$.
  Notice that
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B}_2 \subseteq \mathcal{B}_1 \subseteq \mathcal{B}.
  \end{equation*}
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  In $\mathbb{R}^2$, we can do a similar construction of $\mathcal{B}$,
  $\mathcal{B}_1$, and $\mathcal{B}_2$ as in the last example and use
  them as a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$. In particular, we would have
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B} = \left\{ (a_1, b_1) \times (a_2, b_2) \mmid a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2 \in \mathbb{R} \right\}.
  \end{equation*}
  This is called a \hldefn{dyadic partitioning} of $\mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  Let $(X_1, \mathcal{T}_1)$ and $(X_2, \mathcal{T}_2)$ be two topological spaces.
  Then the Cartesian product $X_1 \times X_2$ has topology induced
  from $\mathcal{T}_1$ and $\mathcal{T}_2$ by taking the set
  \begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{B} = \left\{ \beta_1 \times \beta_2 \mmid \beta_1 \in \mathcal{T}_1, \, \beta_2 \in \mathcal{T}_2 \right\}
  \end{equation*}
  as the basis.
\end{eg}

\begin{ex}
  Prove that
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ can be taken to be elements of
      bases $\mathcal{B}_1 \subset \mathcal{T}_1$ and
      $\mathcal{B}_2 \subset \mathcal{T}_2$, respectively.
    \item the product topology on $\mathbb{R}^2$ is the same
      as the Euclidean topology.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{ex}

\label{sec:euclidean_space_continued_2}
% section euclidean_space_continued_2

\marginnote{The student is recommended to do a quick review for the first 3
chapters of the recommended text.}

Let $\tilde{X}$ be a metric space, and $p, q \in \tilde{X}$ with $p \neq q$.
Then we have that $d(p, q) = r > 0$.
\begin{marginfigure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[circle,fill,inner sep=1pt,label={270:{$p$}}] at (0, 0) {};
    \node[circle,fill,inner sep=1pt,label={270:{$q$}}] at (2, 1) {};
    \draw[latex'-latex'] (0, 0) -- (2, 1) node[midway,fill=dark] {r};
    \draw[dashed] (0, 0) circle(0.7);
    \draw[dashed] (2, 1) circle(0.7);
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Idea of separation}\label{fig:idea_of_separation}
\end{marginfigure}
Then we must have that
\begin{equation*}
  B \left( p, \frac{r}{3} \right) \cap B \left( q, \frac{r}{3} \right) = \emptyset.
\end{equation*}

\begin{ex}
  Prove that the above claim is true. (Use the triangle inequality)
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  Suppose $\exists x \in B \left( p, \frac{r}{3} \right) \cap B \left( q, \frac{r}{3} \right)$.
  Then
  \begin{equation*}
    d(p, x) + d(q, x) < \frac{2r}{3} < r = d(p, q),
  \end{equation*}
  which violates the triangle inequality.\qed\
\end{proof}

We observe here that the two open sets (or balls) ``separate'' $p$ and $q$.

\begin{defn}[Hausdorff / $T_2$]\index{Hausdorff}\index{$T_2$}\label{defn:hausdorff_t_2_}
  Let $X$ be a topological space. $X$ is said to be \hlnoteb{Hausdorff} or \hlnoteb{$T_2$}
  iff any $2$ distinct points can be separated by disjoint open sets.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item The Hausdorff space (or $T_2$ space) is an important space;
      we can only define a metric on spaces that are $T_2$.
    \item A space is called \hldefn{$T_1$} is for any $p, q \in X$ with $p \neq q$,
      $\exists U \ni p$ open such that $q \notin U$ and $\exists V \ni q$ open
      such that $p \notin v$. It is worth noting that a $T_2$ space is also
      $T_1$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{note}

\begin{eg}[The Discrete Topology]
  Suppose $X$ is a metric space. For any $x \in X$, we have that $\left\{ x \right\}$ is open.
  Thus for any $x_1, x_2 \in X$, if $x_1 \neq x_2$, then the open sets
  $\left\{ x_1 \right\}$ and $\left\{ x_2 \right\}$ separates $x_1$ and $x_2$.

  This is true as we can define the following metric on the space:
  let $d : X \times X \to \mathbb{R}$ such that
  \begin{equation*}
    d(x_1, x_2) = \begin{cases}
      0 & x_1 = x_2 \\
      1 & x_1 \neq x_2
    \end{cases}
  \end{equation*}
  This topology is called a \hldefn{discrete topology}, and it is a metric space.
\end{eg}

Let $X$ be a metric space and $A \subseteq X$. Then there is a metric induced by
$X$ on $A$, and this in turn induces a topology on $A$.

More generally, if $A \subset X$ where $X$ is some arbitrary topological space,
then a set $U \subseteq A$ is open iff $U = A \cap V$ for some $V \subseteq X$
that is open. In other words, a subset $U$ of $A$ is said to be open iff we can
find an open set $V$ in $X$ such that the intersection of $A$ and $V$ gives us
$U$.

\begin{ex}
  Prove that the construction above gives us a topology.
\end{ex}

\begin{proof}
  Let $A \subseteq X$. We shall show that $\tau_A$ is a topological space induced
  by the topological space $\tau$ of $X$. It is clear that $\emptyset \in \tau_A$,
  since it is open in $X$, and so $A \cap \emptyset = \emptyset$. Since $X$ is open,
  we have $A \cap X = A$, and so $A \in \tau_A$.

  Now if $\left\{ U_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in I} \subseteq \tau_A$, then
  $\exists V_\alpha \subseteq X$ such that $U_\alpha = A \cap V_\alpha$. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha = \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} A \cap V_\alpha
      = A \cap \bigcup_{\alpha \in I} V_\alpha,
  \end{equation*}
  and $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} V_\alpha$ is open in $X$ by the properties of open
  sets. Thus $\bigcup_{\alpha \in I} U_\alpha \in \tau_A$.

  If $\left\{ U_i \right\}_{i = 1}^{n} \subset \tau_A$, then again, by the properties
  of open sets, finite intersection of open sets is open, and so $\bigcap_{i=1}^{n} U_i \in \tau_A$.

  \qed\
\end{proof}

\begin{note}
  We can say the same can be said about closed sets of $A$.
\end{note}

\begin{eg}
  Let $A \subseteq X$ and consider the function
  \begin{equation*}
    \iota_A : A \to X \text{ given by } x \mapsto x,
  \end{equation*}
  which is the inclusion map.

  Then $\iota_A$ is continuous when the topology on $A$ is chosen to be the
  induced subspace topology. This is rather clear; notice that the inverse
  of the inclusion map brings open sets to open sets.
\end{eg}

Let $Y$ be an arbitrary topological space. Then let

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzcd}
     &  & X \\
     &  &  \\
    Y \arrow[rr, "f"] \arrow[rruu, "\iota_A \circ f"] &  & A \arrow[uu, "\iota_A"]
  \end{tikzcd}
  \caption{Composition of a function and the inclusion map}
  \label{fig:composition_of_a_function_and_the_inclusion_map}
\end{figure}

where $f$ is continuous. Then $\iota_A \circ f$ is continuous.

The converse is also true: if $\iota_A \circ f$ is continuous, then $f$ is continuous.
However, we will not prove this. This property is known as the
\hlnoteb{characteristic property of the subspace topology}.

\begin{lemma}[Restriction of a Continuous Map is Continuous]\label{lemma:restriction_of_a_continuous_map_is_continuous}
  Let $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$ be continuous, and $A \subseteq X$
  \sidenote{Here, $A$ is equipped with the subspace topology}. Then
  \begin{equation*}
    f \restriction_{A} : A \to Y
  \end{equation*}
  is also continuous.

Consider the real line $\mathbb{R}$, and consider two disjoint intervals on $\mathbb{R}$.

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Motivation for Connectedness}
  \label{fig:motivation_for_connectedness}
\end{figure}

Observe that we may find two open subsets $U$ and $V$ of $\mathbb{R}$ such that $A_1 \subseteq U$
and $A_2 \subseteq V$, which effectively separates the two intervals on the space $\mathbb{R}$.

\begin{defn}[Disconnectedness]\index{Disconnectedness}\label{defn:disconnectedness}
  A space $X$ is said to be \hlnoteb{disconnected} iff $X$ can be written as a
  disjoint union
  \begin{equation*}
    X = A_1 \coprod A_2
  \end{equation*}
  where $A_1, A_2 \subseteq X$, $A_1 = A_2^C$, that they are both non-empty and open
  \sidenote{It goes without saying that the two sets are also simultaneously closed.}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Connctedness]\index{Connctedness}\label{defn:connctedness}
  A space $X$ is said to be \hlnoteb{connected} if it is not disconnected.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  By the above definitions, we have that $X$ is connected iff for any partition
  $X = A \coprod A^C$ with $A$ being open, either $A$ is $\emptyset$ or $A$ is $X$.
\end{note}

\begin{eg}
  The space $\mathbb{R} \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}$ is disconnected; our disjoint sets
  are $(-\infty, 0)$ and $(0, \infty)$.
\end{eg}

However, $\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus \left\{ 0 \right\}$ is connected, but it is not easy to
describe why.

\begin{defn}[Path]\index{Path}\label{defn:path}
  A \hlnoteb{path} in a space $X$ from $p$ to $q$ (both in $X$) is a continuous map
  $f : [0, 1] \to X$ such that $f(0) = p$ and $f(1) = q$. We say that $X$ is
  \hldefn{path connected} if $\forall p, q \in X$, there is a path in $X$ from $p$
  to $q$.
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}[Path Connectedness implies Connectedness]\label{lemma:path_connectedness_implies_connectedness}
  If a space $X$ is path connected, then it is connected.
\end{lemma}

\begin{thm}[From Connected Space to Connected Space]\label{thm:from_connected_space_to_connected_space}
  If $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$ is continuous and $X$ is connected, then
  $\Img(f)$ is connected.

\begin{defn}[Locally Connected]\index{Locally Connected}\label{defn:locally_connected}
  We say that $X$ is \hlnoteb{locally connected} at $x$ if for every open set $V$
  containing $x$ there exists a connected, open set $U$ with $x \in U \subseteq V$. We say that
  the space $X$ is \hlnoteb{locally connected} if it is locally connected $\forall x \in X$.
\end{defn}

\begin{eg}
  The space $S$ generated by the function $\sin \frac{1}{x}$ with $0$ at $x = 0$,
  on the $\mathbb{R}^2$ is not locally connected: consider $(0, y) \in S, y \neq 0$.
  Then any small open ball at this point will contain infinitely many line segments from $S$.
  This cannot be connected, as each one of these constitutes a component,
  within the neighborhood.
\end{eg}

\begin{defn}[Connected Component]\index{Connected Component}\label{defn:connected_component}
  The maximal connected subsets of any topological space $X$ are called
  \hlnoteb{connected components} of the space. The components form a partition
  of the space.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Sequential Compactness]\index{Sequential Compactness}\label{defn:sequential_compactness}
  For $A \subseteq X$, where $X$ is a topological space, if
  $\left\{ x_i \right\}_{i \in I} \subseteq A$, arbitrary sequence in $A$, has a
  convergent subsequence, we say that $A$ is \hlnoteb{sequentially compact}.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Compactness]\index{Compactness}\label{defn:compactness}
  We say that a topological space $X$ is \hlnoteb{compact} if every \hlnotea{open cover}
  of $X$ has a finite \hlnotea{subcover}.
\end{defn}

\begin{lemma}[Compactness implies Sequential Compactness]\label{lemma:compactness_implies_sequential_compactness}
  Compactness implies sequential compactness.
\end{lemma}

\begin{eg}
  $[ 0, 1 )$ is not compact: consider the open cover
  $\left\{ \left[ 0, 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right) \right\}_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$, which contains
  $[0, 1)$ as $n \to \infty$. But whenever $n$ is finite, we have $1 - \frac{1}{n} < 1$,
  and so any finite collection of the $\left[0, \frac{1}{n}\right)$ is not a cover of
  $[0, 1)$.
\end{eg}

\begin{thm}[Continuous Maps map Compact Sets to Compact Images]\label{thm:continuous_maps_map_compact_sets_to_compact_images}
  Let $f : X \to Y$ be continuous, where $X$ is compact. Then $f(X)$ is compact.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\left\{ U_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in I}$ be an open cover of $f(X)$. Since
  $f$ is continuous, we have that $f^{-1} \left( U_\alpha \right)$ is open for each
  $\alpha \in I$. Since $f$ is bijective between the image set and its domain, we
  have that $\left\{ f^{-1} \left( U_\alpha \right) \right\}_{\alpha \in I}$ is an
  open cover of $X$. Since $X$ is compact, this cover has a finite subcover, say
  $\left\{ f^{-1} \left( U_i \right) \right\}_{i = 1}^{n}$. Thus
  \begin{equation*}
    X = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} f^{-1} \left( U_i \right).
  \end{equation*}
  Thus
  \begin{equation*}
    f(X) = f \left( \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} f^{-1} \left( U_i \right) \right) = \bigcup_{i=1}^{n} U_i.
  \end{equation*}
  Hence $\left\{ U_\alpha \right\}_{\alpha \in I}$ has a finite subcover and so
  $f(X)$ is compact.\qed\
\end{proof}

\begin{crly}[Homeomorphic Maps map Compact Sets to Compact Sets]\label{crly:homeomorphic_maps_map_compact_sets_to_compact_sets}
  Let $X \overset{f}{\to} Y$ be a homeomorphism. Then $X$ is compact iff
  $Y$ is compact.
\end{crly}

\begin{note}
  Compactness is a topological property.
\end{note}

\begin{lemma}[Properties of Compact Sets]\label{lemma:properties_of_compact_sets}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item A closed subset of a compact space is compact.
    \item A compact subset of a topological space is closed provided that the
      space is Hausdorff.
    \item In a metric space, a compact set is bounded.
    \item Finite (Cartesian) product of compact sets is compact.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}

The proof for the first item is simple: consider an open cover of the closed subset,
and union them with the complement of the closed subset. This covers the entire space,
and so it has a finite subcover. We just need to then remove that complement set, and
that would be a finite subcover for the closed subset.

\begin{eg}
  The subset $[-a, b]$, $a, b \in \mathbb{R}$, is compact.
\end{eg}

\begin{eg}
  $[0, 1]^{\mathbb{N}}$ is not compact: the space is equivalent to $\ell_\infty$.
\end{eg}

\begin{thm}[Heine-Borel]\index{Heine-Borel}\label{thm:heine_borel}
  Let $X \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Then $X$ is compact iff $X$ is closed and bounded.
\end{thm}

\begin{proof}
  \hlbnoted{$(\implies)$} We say that compactness impliess boundedness. Also, since
  $\mathbb{R}^n$ is Hausdorff, $X$ is closed.\sidenote{Both from
  \cref{lemma:properties_of_compact_sets}}.

  \noindent
  \hlbnoted{$(\impliedby)$} $X$ is bounded implies that $X \subseteq [-R, R]^n$ with $R$
  sufficiently large. Since $X$ is closed, and $[-R, R]^n$ is compact, $X$ is necessarily
  compact by \cref{lemma:properties_of_compact_sets}.\qed\
\end{proof}

\begin{thm}[Bolzano-Weierstrass]\index{Bolzano-Weierstrass}\label{thm:bolzano_weierstrass}
  Every bounded sequence in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a convergent subsequence.

\begin{defn}[Locally Homeomorphic]\index{Locally Homeomorphic}\label{defn:locally_homeomorphic}
  A space is said to be \hlnoteb{locally homeomorphic} to $\mathbb{R}^n$ provided that
  $\forall x \in X$, $\exists U \ni x$ open such that $U$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}[Manifold]\index{Manifold}\label{defn:manifold}
  An $n$-dimensional \hlnoteb{manifold} is a \hlnotec{second countable}\sidenote{
  a topological space is said to be \hldefn{second countable} if its basis is
  countable.}, \hlnotec{Hausdorff} topological space that is \hlnotec{locally
  homeomorphic} to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  One can give an equivalent definition of locally homeomorphic by requiring that
  $U$ be homeomorphic to an open ball $B^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Notice that
  $B^n$ is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$ \sidenote{By scaling, really.}
\end{note}

\begin{eg}
  Let $B^n = B^n(0, 1) \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Then $B^n$ is homeomorphic to
  $\mathbb{R}^n$.

\begin{eg}
  Now consider the closed ball $\bar{B}^n = \bar{B}^n(0, 1) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. This is
  actually not a manifold, but we are not yet there to prove this. This sort of a structure
  motivates us to the next definition.

  An $n$-dimensional space that is second countable and Hausdorff, such that $\forall x \in X$,
  there exists a neighbourhood either homeomorphic to $B^n \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ or

\begin{defn}[Interior Point]\index{Interior Point}\label{defn:interior_point}
  A point $x \in M$ is called an \hlnoteb{interior point} if there is a local
  homeomorphism
  \begin{equation*}
    \phi : \mathcal{U} \to \mathbb{B} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n,
  \end{equation*}
  where $\mathcal{U}$ is open.
\end{defn}

In the last lecture we asked ourselves the following: how do we know if the
idea of `being on a boundary' is a well-defined notion? In particular, how
do well tell the difference between the following two graphs, mathematically?

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-2, 0) -- (2,0);
    \draw[->] (0, -2) -- (0,2);

    \node at (1.5,1.5) {$\mathbb{R}^n$};

  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{How do we tell the difference between the two graphs?}
  \label{fig:r_n_vs_h_n}
\end{figure*}

\begin{defn}[Boundary Point]\index{Boundary Point}\label{defn:boundary_point}
  A point $x$ is on the boundary of $M$, denoted as $x \in \partial M$, if
  there exists $\mathcal{U} \ni x$ that is open, and a homeomorphism
  \begin{equation*}
    \psi : \mathcal{U} \to \mathbb{B}_{0, 1} \cap \mathbb{H}^n.
  \end{equation*}
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  The $\phi$ in \cref{defn:interior_point} and $\psi$ in \cref{defn:boundary_point}
  are called \hldefn{local charts}.

  Also, our definitions do not rule out, e.g.
  \begin{gather*}
    \phi_2 : \mathcal{U} \to \mathbb{B}^2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \\
    \phi_5 : \mathcal{U} \to \mathbb{B}^5 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^5.
  \end{gather*}
\end{note}

We shall later on prove that a point cannot simultaneously be a boundary point and
an interior point. This property is called \hlnotea{the invariance of the boundary}.
\sidenote{This also means that $\Int{M} \cap \partial M = \emptyset$. Also, by
\cref{defn:manifold}, $\Int{M} \cup \partial M = M$.}

\begin{note}
  $\Int{M}$ is open. Thus, we can use the same definition about open sets as
  before using $\phi$.
\end{note}

\begin{note}
  In contrast, $\partial M$ is closed; thanks to the invariance of the boundary
  we have that $\partial M = M \setminus \Int{M}$ and $\Int{M}$ is open, and so
  $\left( \partial M \right)^C = \Int{M}$.
\end{note}

We shall also prove the following theorem later on:

\begin{thmnonum}[Invariance of the Dimension]\label{thmnonum:invariance_of_the_dimension}
  The $n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is well-defined.
\end{thmnonum}

\begin{eg}
  Consider the equation
  \begin{equation}\label{eg:equation_of_a_3d_cone}
    x^2 - y^2 - z^2 = 0.
  \end{equation}
  Note that we may write
  \begin{equation*}
    x = \pm \sqrt{ y^2 + z^2 },
  \end{equation*}
  and so the graph generated by \cref{eg:equation_of_a_3d_cone} is as shown in
  \cref{fig:a_3d_cone_in_r_3_}.
  \begin{marginfigure}
    \centering

    \caption{A 3D cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$, from WolframAlpha}\label{fig:a_3d_cone_in_r_3_}
  \end{marginfigure}
  However, this is not a manifold: if we assume that a ball arounnd the origin
  is homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$, then by removing the point at the origin
  in the cone, the cone becomes two disconnected components, but the ball in
  $\mathbb{R}^2$ homeomorphic to the aforementioned ball is still connected.
\end{eg}

  An open subset of a manifold is a manifold, by restriction.

\subsection{The $1$-Sphere $S^1$}%

% subsection the_1_sphere_s_1_

From \cref{eg:basis_of_r_n}, we have
\begin{itemize}
  \item $[0, 1) \simeq [0, \infty)$ is a manifold with boundary;
  \item $(0, 1) \simeq \mathbb{R}$ is a manifold; and
  \item $[0, 1]$ is a manifold with boundary.
\end{itemize}

  \begin{gather*}
    \theta_1 \to e^{i \theta_1} \text{ and } \theta_2 \to e^{i \theta_2 + \pi},
  \end{gather*}
  which gives us the graphs:

  respectively. Note that the image of both these functions are not compact.
  Regardless, this gives us a basis for $S^1$, which we notice is countable,
  Hausdorff, and locally homeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^2$.
\end{eg}

\begin{thm}[$1$-Dimensional Manifolds Determined by Its Compactness]\label{thm:_1_dimensional_manifolds_determined_by_its_compactness}

\label{sub:the_1_sphere_s_1_continued}
% subsection the_1_sphere_s_1_continued

\paragraph{Set theoretic view of $S^1$}
We showed that $S^1$ is a manifold. We can, in fact, set theoretically, look
at $S^1$ as $A = [0, 1]$ glued at the endpoints, i.e. we \hlnotea{identify}
the points $0$ and $1$ as `the same', and label this notion as $0 \sim 1$.

\paragraph{Topological view of $S^1$}
Topologically, for $0 \sim 1$ in $A$, we can construct an open set around the
point such that the open set is properly contained in $A$.

\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[{Bracket[length=5pt,width=15pt]}-{Bracket[length=5pt,width=15pt]}] (-2, 0) -- (2, 0);
    \draw[-{Arc Barb[length=5pt,width=15pt]},be-blue] (-2,0) -- (-1,0);
    \draw[{Arc Barb[length=5pt,width=15pt]}-,be-blue] (1,0) -- (2,0);
    \node[circle,fill=be-blue,inner sep=1.5pt] at (-2, 0) {};
    \node[circle,fill=be-blue,inner sep=1.5pt] at (2, 0) {};
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Topological representation of $A$}
  \label{fig:topological_representation_of_a}
\end{figure}

But how can we describe this notion mathematically so?

\newthought{Consider} the real line as follows:

\begin{figure*}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]
    \draw[->] (-5, 0) -- (5, 0);
    \foreach \x in {-4,-3,...,4} {
      \draw[dashed,color=be-blue] (\x,0.5) -- (\x,-0.5);
      \node[circle,fill,inner sep=2pt,label={270:{$\x$}}] at (\x, 0) {};
      \node[label={[label distance=1]above:{$T^{\x}(a)$}}] at (\x + 0.3, 0) {$( \times )$};
      \node at (\x + 0.7, 0) {$\blacktriangle$};
    }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Breaking down the real line into parts}
  \label{fig:breaking_down_the_real_line_into_parts}
\end{figure*}

Let's define $T : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ such that $x \mapsto x + 1$. Clearly
so, $T$ is bijective and, in particular, has an inverse $x \mapsto x - 1$.

Notice that within each interval $[x, x + 1]$, we can find a $\times$ and
$\blacktriangle$ at the same distance from $x$. Also, notice that we can use the
same radius for $\times$ such that the open ball around $\times$ sits in $[x, x + 1]$
for each $x \in \mathbb{Z}$.

Thus, instead of studying the entire real line at once, we can reduce our attention
only to $[0, 1]$, and simply scale the interval with a `scalar multiplication' to
get to wherever we want on the real line.

Now let
\begin{equation*}
  G := \left\{ T^k \mmid k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\},
\end{equation*}
which is evidently a \hldefn{group}. Furthermore, every element in $G$ is a
homeomorphism to $\mathbb{R}$. Let $G$ \hldefn{act on} $\mathbb{R}$, and for
$a \in \mathbb{R}$, consider the \hldefn{orbit} of $a$, which is denoted as
\begin{equation*}
  G \cdot a := \left\{ T^k (a) \mmid k \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}.
\end{equation*}
Then
\begin{equation*}
  S^1 \simeq \text{ the space of all orbits of } G \text{ acting on } \mathbb{R} =: \mathbb{R} / G,
\end{equation*}
where $\simeq$ represents \hyperref[defn:homeomorphism]{homeomorphism}.
\sidenote{$\mathbb{R} / G$ is the \hldefn{quotient space} of $\mathbb{R}$ over $G$.}
Also, notice that here, $G$ is effectively $\mathbb{Z}$.

This realization implies the existence of some topology on $S^1$.

\newthought{Thus far}, we have seen that we may look at $S^1$
\begin{itemize}
  \item set theoretically: as $A = [0, 1]$ with glued endpoints; and
  \item topologically: as $\mathbb{R} \setminus \mathbb{Z}$.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{$S^1$ as a topological group}
Since $\mathbb{C} \simeq \mathbb{R}^2$, we may think of $S^1$ as a
sphere on the complex plane.

\end{figure*}
We see that this `group' takes on the operation of adding the indices
of the exponents. Thus $G = ( S^1, \cdot )$. Notice that $G$ is indeed
a group equipped with said operation, and for each $z_1 \in G$, there
exists $z_1^{-1} = \frac{1}{z_1} \in G$ such that
$z_1 \cdot \frac{1}{z_1} = 1$.

Furthermore, the function
\begin{gather*}
  \iota : S^1 \to S^1 \text{ given by } z \mapsto \frac{1}{z} \\
  \text{ which is } e^{i \theta} \mapsto e^{- i \theta}
\end{gather*}
is continuous.

Also, the function
\begin{equation*}
  P : S^1 \times S^1 \to S^1 \text{ given by } (z_1, z_2) \mapsto z_1 z_2
\end{equation*}
is continuous.

\begin{defn}[Topological Group]\index{Topological Group}\label{defn:topological_group}
  If $G$ is a group, and functions $\iota$ and $P$ as defined above,
  if both $\iota$ and $P$ are continuous, then we say that $G$ is a
  \hlnoteb{topological group}.
\end{defn}

\paragraph{$S^1$ as a moduli space}

\begin{defn}[Moduli Space]\index{Moduli Space}\label{defn:moduli_space}
  A \hlnoteb{moduli space} is the space of all lines passing through
  the origin.
\end{defn}

On $\mathbb{R}^2$, we have
\begin{figure}[ht]
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-2, 0) -- (2, 0);
    \draw[->] (0, -2) -- (0, 2);
    \draw (0, 0) circle(1);

    \clip (-2, -2) rectangle (2, 2);
    \foreach \m in {-3,-2.5,...,3} {
      \draw[color=be-blue] plot ({\x}, {\m * \x});
    }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{The moduli space on $\mathbb{R}^2$}
  \label{fig:the_moduli_space_on_r_2_}
\end{figure}

First, how can we understand `closeness' in a moduli space?
We can actually look at the difference in the radians of each
line, or really just $x / 360$ and compare the $x$'s.

Also, notice that each line passes through $S^1$ twice. We can
indeed avoid this problem by shifting $S^1$ to one side, as
shown in \cref{fig:shifted_s_1_for_the_moduli_space}.
\begin{marginfigure}
  \centering
  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[->] (-1, 0) -- (3, 0);
    \draw[->] (0, -2) -- (0, 2);
    \draw (1, 0) circle(1);

    \clip (-2, -2) rectangle (3, 2);
    \foreach \m in {-3,-2.5,...,3} {
      \draw[color=be-blue] plot ({\x}, {\m * \x});
    }
  \end{tikzpicture}
  \caption{Shifted $S^1$ for the moduli space}\label{fig:shifted_s_1_for_the_moduli_space}
\end{marginfigure}
Now each line intersects $S^1$ at the origin and another
point on $S^1$, and this intersection is in fact unique.

    \caption{The $2$-sphere $S^2$}
    \label{fig:the_2_sphere_s_2_}
  \end{marginfigure}
  Note that we may `cover' this sphere by the function $f_{-} : \mathbb{D} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2 \to \mathbb{R}$,
  where $\mathbb{D}$ is the unit disc in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and $f_{-}$ is given by
  \begin{equation*}
    (x, y) \mapsto - \sqrt{1 - (x^2 + y^2)}.
  \end{equation*}
  We see that $f_{-}$ is a chart for the lower hemisphere for \cref{fig:the_2_sphere_s_2_}, shaded red.
  We can indeed cover the entire $2$-sphere with similar hemispheres in different orientations: consider
  \begin{gather*}
    f_+ (x, y) = \sqrt{ 1 - x^2 - y^2 } \\
    g_+ (x, z) = \sqrt{ 1 - x^2 - z^2 } \\
    g_- (x, z) = - \sqrt{ 1 - x^2 - z^2 } \\
    h_+ (y, z) = \sqrt{ 1 - y^2 - z^2 } \\
    h_- (y, z) = - \sqrt{ 1 - y^2 - z^2 },
  \end{gather*}
  which represent the upper hemisphere, eastern hemisphere, western hemisphere, front hemisphere,
  and back hemisphere, respectively.
\end{eg}

We have the following general observation: let $f : \mathcal{U} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$
be a real-valued continuous function. Then $\Gamma(f)$ is \hlnotea{parameterized} using $f$, i.e. $f$
constructs the chart $\Gamma(f)$.

We have not explicitly defined what $\Gamma(f)$ is, but it is recorded
in \href{https://tex.japorized.ink/PMATH733/classnotes.pdf\#page.32}{PMATH 733}, but we shall provide a
short definition here for reference: the \hldefn{graph} $\Gamma(f)$ of the function $f$ is defined as
\begin{equation*}
  \Gamma(f) := \left\{ (x_1, \ldots, x_n, y) \mmid f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = y \right\}.
\end{equation*}

It is interesting to note that $\Gamma(f)$ is homeomorphic to $\mathcal{U}$. Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
  \Phi : \mathcal{U} \to \Gamma(F) \text{ given by } \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (x_1, \ldots, x_n, f(x_1, \ldots, x_n)).
\end{equation*}
It is clear that $\Phi$ is continuous since each of its components are continuous. However, it is not
as easy to find a continuous map to go from $\Gamma(f)$ to $\mathcal{U}$.

\begin{defn}[Projection]\index{Projection}\label{defn:projection}
  We define function $\pi_{n + 1} : \Gamma(f) \to \mathcal{U}$ by
  \begin{equation*}
    \pi_{n + 1}(x_1, \ldots, x_n, y) = (x_1, \ldots, x_n),
  \end{equation*}
  which is called a \hlnoteb{projection}.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item In A1, we showed that $\pi_{n + 1}$ is continuous.
    \item Furthermore, $\pi_{n + 1}$ is injective.
    \item Thus, we observe that
      \begin{equation*}
        \pi_{n + 1} \circ \Phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = (x_1, \ldots, x_n) = id_{n + 1}(x_1, \ldots, x_n).

\end{marginfigure}
\marginnote{I was definitely not trying to make a Pokeball.}

In a more mathematical sense, we are identifying the lower and upper boundaries of the upper
and lower hemisphere, respectively, i.e. we identify
\begin{equation*}
  S^n = \bar{\mathbb{B}}^n \times \{ 0 \} \cup \bar{\mathbb{B}}^n \times \{ 1 \},
\end{equation*}
where the $\{ 0 \}$ and $\{ 1 \}$ represent the upper and lower hemispheres, respectively. We
may also write this as
\begin{equation*}
  x \in \partial \bar{\mathbb{B}}^n : (x, 0) \sim (x, 1).
\end{equation*}

This calls for the notion of an equivalence class. Recall that an \hldefn{equivalence relation}
on a set $A$ is a relation between elements such that
\begin{enumerate}
  \item (reflexity) $x \sim x$;
  \item (symmetry) $x \sim y \iff y \sim x$; and
  \item (transitivity) $x \sim y \, \land \, y \sim z \implies x \sim z$,
\end{enumerate}
where $\sim$ is our equivalence relation.

Equivalence relations give rise to the notion of \hldefn{equivalence classes}, where we define
an equivalence class as
\begin{equation*}
  [\beta] := \{ \alpha \in A \mid \beta \sim \alpha \}.
\end{equation*}
In this course, we shall sometimes denote equivalence classes in the form of $A_\beta$. Notice
that
\begin{equation*}
  A = \coprod\limits_{\beta \in B} A_\beta,
\end{equation*}
where $B \subseteq A$.

\newthought{This begs the question}: do the set of equivalence classes retain the topology of
the space?

Here, we look into \hldefn{quotient topology}. Let $A^*$ be the space of equivalence classes,
and let's assume that $A$ is endowed with a topology. Consider the function
\begin{equation*}
  \pi : A \to A^* \text{ given by } a \mapsto [a]_{\sim},
\end{equation*}
where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation, and $[a]_{\sim}$ is the equivalence class that $a$
belongs to\sidenote{Note that the function is well-defined as the equivalence classes are
disjoint.}.

  \end{tikzcd}
  \caption{Relationship of $A$, $A^*$ and $Z$}
  \label{fig:relationship_of_a_a_and_z_}
\end{figure}

Consider an arbitrary space $Z$ that is also endowed with a topology, such that
$\exists g : A \to Z$ that is continuous, such that $g$ is constant on each of the equivalence
classes of $A$, that is, if $a \sim b$, then $g(a) = g(b)$.

Then $\tilde{g}$ is a well-defined function induced on $A^*$: we have that
\begin{equation*}
  \tilde{g}(\pi(a)) = g(a).
\end{equation*}

We want to endow $A^*$ with a topology such that $\tilde{g}$ will be continuous. However,
\begin{itemize}
  \item if $A^*$ is too `fine', then $\pi$ may not be continuous; and
  \item if $A^*$ is too `course', then $\tilde{g}$ may not be continuous.
\end{itemize}
We need to strike a balance in the fineness of the topology of $A^*$ to make sure that both
$\pi$ and $\tilde{g}$ are continuous.

\begin{defn}[Strongly Continuous]\index{Strongly Continuous}\label{defn:strongly_continuous}
  Let $\mathcal{V} \subseteq A^*$. $\mathcal{V}$ is open iff $\exists \mathcal{U} \subseteq A$
  such that $\pi(\mathcal{U}) = \mathcal{V}$. We say that $\pi$ is \hlnoteb{strongly continuous}.
\end{defn}

\begin{warning}
  $\pi$ may not be an open map!

With the topology that we last introduced for $A^*$, $g$ is continuous iff $\tilde{f}$ is continuous.
\marginnote{This way of constructing a quotient space is intuitive ring theoretically.}
However, this is a rather cumbersome way to construct a quotient space. In particular, how do we know
what equivalence class should we choose?

\begin{defn}[Saturated]\index{Saturated}\label{defn:saturated}
  We say that a subset $S \subseteq A$ is \hlnoteb{saturated} (wrt $\pi$) provided that it is has
  a \hlimpo{non-empty intersection} with a fibre $\pi^{-1}(\{ q \})$, where $q \in A^*$, then
  $S \supseteq \pi^{-1}(\{ q \})$.
\end{defn}

\begin{note}
  This definition is equivalent to saying that $\pi^{-1} \circ \pi (S) = S$.
\end{note}

With this definition, we may restate the definition of a quotient map in a clearer way.

\begin{defn}[Quotient Map]\index{Quotient Map}\label{defn:quotient_map}
  A map $g : X \to Y$ is called a \hlnoteb{quotient map} if it sends saturated open subsets of $X$
  to open subsets of $Y$.
\end{defn}
